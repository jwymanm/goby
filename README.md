Develop iOS apps with ClojureScript.

Overview
========

This repository contains some ClojureScript and Objective-C glue code that facilitates creating iOS apps where the view controllers are written in ClojureScript instead of Objectiveâ€‘C or Swift.

This approach was taken to build [an app](http://fikesfarm.com/cc/) currently in the App Store, and this repo is derived from the reusable bits from that project.

Check out the companion example project [Shrimp](https://github.com/mfikes/shrimp) illustrating actual use of this code.
